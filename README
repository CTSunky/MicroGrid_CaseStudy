This is the MG Case Study that is submitted to Annals of Operations Research on 10/14/2019

The "main.m" file is the main module of the case study. It has all the design variables and calls other functions to conduct the analysis described in the paper. 
The main module reads the NREL data from "FL_normalrandom.xlsx", then simulates the Micro Grid Production behavior using the other functions.
Once the algortihm finishes, it creates a csv. file that include the input and output data of the decision-making units (DMUs).
